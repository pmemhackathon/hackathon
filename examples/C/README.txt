This example shows how to use CacheLib on hetergoenous memory system.

This example consists of these files:

basic.cpp         -- code sample that shows how to configure and use cachelib
build.sh          -- script for building this example
run.sh            -- one way to run this example to illustrate what it does
bench_config.json -- benchmark configuration
run_benchmark.sh  -- script to run cachelib benchmark

Other files are just dependencies for the build system and for the benchmark.

To build this example run: ./build.sh
To run it and see what it illustrates run: ./run.sh and ./run_benchmark.sh

Modifying the code and run steps is a great way to learn from this example.
