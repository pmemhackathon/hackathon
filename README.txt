This is the workshop repo.  If you're reading this through a webhackathon
window or a workshop SSH session, then you're probably looking at your
own private copy of the repo.

This repo contains the slides and examples used for pmem hackathons.

It is provided permanently for reference on GitHub:

	https://github.com/pmemhackathon/hackathon

The PDF files at the top level contain slides:

	slides.pdf         -- essential hackathon background
	slides-java.pdf    -- java background
	pmdk-overview.pdf  -- overview of Persistent Memory Development Kit
	libpmemobj.pdf     -- overview of libpmemobj (C API)
	libpmemobj-cpp.pdf -- overview of libpmemobj (C++ API)

The examples are in examples/A, exmamples/B, etc.  Each example is meant
to show a persistent memory programming concept, like transactions,
support for a specific language, and API, etc.	The idea is to use
the first few examples (A through C) to gain some essential background
knowledge, then pick examples that are interesting to you.  Use them as a
starting point, or a reference as you develop your own persistent memory
aware programs.  There's a README.txt file in each example directory
that explains what the example is all about.

For more information, contact andy.rudoff@intel.com or post your question
to the "pmem" google group on groups.google.com.

The containers used during the hackathons have all the necessary libraries
installed in them.  You can access the container directly on DockerHub
in the "pmemhackathon" area.  Here are the steps taken to install the
libraries on a Linux machine.  These steps assume you have a machine
with persistent memory installed and a recent Linux distro that supports
persistent memory.

We don't show the ipmctl and ndctl commands used to configure the
persistent memory.  These examples assume persistent memory is available
as a DAX mounted filesystem at "/pmem" on your system.  The following link
provides more details about the steps to configure persistent memory:

# To clone this repo, use something like the command below.
# (Examples assume cloning in your home directory, hence the "cd")
#

cd
git clone https://github.com/pmemhackathon/hackathon

#
# Some of the examples use PMDK.  The distro-supplied libraries like
# libpmemobj should work fine for these examples, but if you want to
# install the very latest versions, take a look at how the docker image
# was created for this workshop.  You can see the Dockerfile, along with
# scripts used to build and install each library, here:
